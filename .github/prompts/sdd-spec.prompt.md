description: Turn a user story into a reviewable spec.
---
Goal: produce `specs/${input:storyId}/spec.md` from `../user-stories/${input:storyId}.md`.

Rules:
- Read the user story file first. Treat it as raw input, not as a spec.
- Ask clarifying questions ONE at a time. Use the "Open questions" section of the user story as a starting point but go beyond it.
- Do not write code or any file other than `specs/${input:storyId}/spec.md`.
- When you have enough information, write the spec using this outline:
  Problem, Users, Scope (in/out), Functional requirements,
  Non-functional requirements, Acceptance criteria, Open questions.
- Stop after writing the spec and wait for approval.
